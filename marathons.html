   <h2>Some thoughts on marathon training</h2> <!-- Add header here -->
   <p><p>It took me 5 attempts to run a sub 3 hour marathon to qualify for the Boston Marathon. I wrote up some thoughts about each race to try to think through what went right and wrong to help with future training. </p>
   <h4 id="-background-"><strong>Background</strong></h4>
   <p>Mid-20&#39;s M. Mediocre HS runner (800m ~2:05, 1600 in 4:40s, 5K &lt;17:30). Ran for fun during college but not on a team. First marathon in 2019. Picked up the miles during COVID and ran 4 marathons in 2022 &amp; 2023. </p>
   <h4 id="-marathons-"><strong>Marathons</strong></h4>
   <ol>
   <li><p>Spring 2019 - 3:02 high - Looking back, I made plenty of rookie mistakes during my homegrown training plan, which was basically one long run and two tempo sessions per week. This approach was inefficient and lacked a solid base. I peaked at around 50 miles for 2 weeks but most of the time was under 40 miles. I trained on the hilly course and the weather was perfect during the race. Predictably, I started way too fast, completing the first half in just over 1:26. I hit the wall at mile 21 and barely managed the last two miles at around 8 minutes each.</p>
   </li>
   <li><p>Spring 2022 - 3:08 high - My training improved significantly, building a base of over 30 miles per week for eight months. For the last couple of months, I followed JD&#39;s 18-week 2Q plan (40mpw version) and peaked at about 45 miles per week. Aiming for a sub-2:55 finish, I completed a tune-up half marathon in 1:23:30 two weeks before the marathon, which in hindsight was a mistake. On race day, challenging weather conditions (cold, sleet, crosswinds, and sun) and unexpected &quot;rolling&quot; hills made the course tougher than expected. I started with another marathoner targeting a 2:53 to 2:55 finish and reached the halfway point at 1:26 flat, which was probably (definitely) too fast. Mentally, I struggled with the idea of a second lap. I started slowing at mile 19, lost the 3-hour pace during mile 20, and completely bonked at mile 24. Walked it in with cramps and muscle spasms, but I felt like I gave it my all.</p>
   </li>
   <li><p>Spring 2022 - 3:07 - Four weeks after my second marathon, I decided to try again, thinking the last one was kind of a 21-mile marathon-pace workout followed by a 5-mile easy jog (nope). I recovered for a couple of weeks, did some stretching, and repeated the last two weeks of workouts. The course was way easier, and I didn&#39;t have to travel. Although the weather was tolerable, it became warmer than desired, reaching 60Â°F. Running with a good group, I finished the first half just over 1:30. I increased my pace slightly for the next six miles but couldn&#39;t maintain it after mile 23. In hindsight, this whole idea was unwise. While I&#39;m glad I attempted it, the chances of success were slim. Fortunately no injuries.</p>
   </li>
   <li><p>November 2022 - 3:11 low - getting slower?? I planned to run the NYC Marathon for fun with a family member, but they got injured in September, so I decided to attempt another sub-3-hour finish. I felt great after completing JD&#39;s 10K plan and added light weightlifting twice a week over the summer. I ran a half at 1:22:20 comfortably 6 weeks out, then switched to the 18/55 2Q workouts for the rest of the block. My training pace and tune-up suggested a 2:53 finish, but I aimed for a conservative 1:28:30 first half due to the challenging NYC course. Also, I splurged on Endorphin Pro 2&#39;s for the race and trained this block in nylon-plated Speed 2&#39;s. On race day, the hot and humid weather prompted me to adjust my plan, aiming for a 1:30 first half. After exiting the Verrazano Bridge, wow the sun was intense, and I felt uneasy already. Despite the heat, the crowd was amazing, and the race was exciting. I completed the first half on target, but slowed down around mile 15 and struggled from mile 21 onwards, finishing with a walk-hobble-jog. My finishing place would&#39;ve been around 2:58 in 2019, so I felt good about my effort. The experience taught me that I can&#39;t control the weather. I&#39;m so glad I got to run this race, though!</p>
   </li>
   <li><p>March 2023 - 2:56 high - Finally! After taking a full month off, I picked an easier course and then followed JD&#39;s 18/55 plan for 15 weeks, with more miles and faster paces. I peaked at 60 miles per week for four weeks, with my highest 7-day total reaching about 80 miles due to the timing of long runs. I maintained my light weightlifting program twice a week and paid more attention to nutrition, ensuring I ate enough to maintain my weight. One of my favorite workouts was 15 miles with 3x2 miles at under 6:00/mi and one mile under 5:50. I was hitting paces from 10K training last summer. During this training block, I avoided major injuries or illnesses and only had to deal with a bit of travel. On race day, the weather was chilly but so preferable to heat. I planned to run a conservative first half at 1:28:30 and maintain a 6:45/mi pace until mile 20, even though my marathon pace during training was 6:15-6:25/mi. The race went according to plan, and I felt more comfortable than in any previous marathon. My heart rate stayed in Zone 3 until mile 15. I increased my effort with about five miles to go, but the wind prevented me from making up much time. Crossing the finish line, I mostly felt relieved and grateful to be there. I finally knew sub-3 wasn&#39;t impossible for me... also building a strong aerobic base takes time; the benefits of 1.5 years of serious training were clear. </p>

   <h4 id="-reflections-"><strong>Reflections</strong></h4>
   <p>My takeaway after running a bunch of marathons close together is that race results hinge on training, conditions, and execution. </p>
   <p>Really every factor is in one of three buckets:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Training. Your plan, mileage, paces, aerobic bace, tuneups, injuries, illnesses, nutrition</li>
   <li>Conditions. The course, field size, weather, travel, support </li>
   <li>Execution. Pacing, strategy, tangents, drafting, mental grit, pre-race meals. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>You can only be short on one of these. Short on two (or one going really bad) and you&#39;ll almost certainly blow up. This is most true over the marathon where conditions &amp; execution are relatively more important than a short race. </p>
   <p>For example, in 2019 I was short training and execution. Spring 2022 I was short conditions and execution. Spring 2022 redux, short training and conditions. NYC was just major conditions. Spring 2023 I got all 3 and sub-3-hr was easy. </p>
   <p>I don&#39;t think these are excuses; rather, it actually makes it more clear how to focus, adjust, and improve.</p></p>
