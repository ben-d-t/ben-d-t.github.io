TODO:
- Increase spacing between words
- Cap out the horizontal length of any page similar to PG: http://www.paulgraham.com/gfaq.html
  - Readwise Reader is formatted similarly
  - A UX article here: https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability
- Learn how to make the sidebar pull from another file so I don't have to replicate it
- Make a template.html file so that it's easier to add something new

DONE:
