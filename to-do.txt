TODO:


DONE:
- Learn how to make the sidebar pull from another file so I don't have to replicate it
  - This works great, but... it loads a little weird because the sidebar + footer load second. Kind of a bummer. So I might change it back sometime
  - Actually this is more my slow old laptop; worked much quicker on my phone
- Cap out the horizontal length of any page similar to PG: http://www.paulgraham.com/gfaq.html
  - Readwise Reader is formatted similarly
  - A UX article here: https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability
- Safari doesn't seem to render the Google font...
  - Wait, actually I think that was color contrast difference b/w my laptop & monitor? Weird
- Increase spacing between words
- Make a template.html file so that it's easier to add something new
