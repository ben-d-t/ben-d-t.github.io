### 0. Why I'm interested
The world has changed more over the [last ~200](https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions) years that any time before. And some people even think we are living in [the single most important century](https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/) because of technological change. I'm generally an optimist about technology -- I think technology can solve climate problems and [[housing|housing problems]] and lots of other problems. 

People shape technology and technology shapes people back. 

Large tech companies have whole teams dedicated to researching and discussing how the company's technology impacts society (e.g., [Google](https://research.google/teams/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/social-sciences/?), although these teams are sometimes [early in layoffs](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/meta-abandons-responsible-innovation-team-as-metaverse-development-contin/631484/)).

By "technology" I like the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) of applying knowledge to practical and reproducible goals. 

By "society" I guess I just mean a bunch of people. 
### 1. Questions I want to explore

Interaction with society:
- Is culture more upstream or downstream of society?
- Are new technologies today met with more or less resistance than in other decades? 
- How can companies responsibly roll out new technology? What options are there? 
- How do religion and technology and progress interact? [[progress-and-religion|A pitch for writing about religion and economic progress]]

History of technology:
- Is uptake of technologies speeding up or slowing down? 
- What technology is most likely to shape the 21st century? 
- [Where is my flying car?](https://press.stripe.com/where-is-my-flying-car#)

Sector trends:
- What trends are shaping the future of real estate? 
- What technology unlocks would most effect [[housing|Housing Affordability]]?

Specific technologies:
- What actually is a semiconductor anyway? 
- What other paradigms might there be for LLMs other than "chat"?
- Exactly what math is underlying ChatGPT? See [What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?—Stephen Wolfram Writings](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/)
- How does a blockchain work?
