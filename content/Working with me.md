I haven't shared it with many people in particular… but it feels helpful for self-reflection (to build self awareness), like a good place to synthesize feedback that I receive, and like it will be even more helpful down the road. 

**What I look for in work**.

I like to work on hard problems, the kind that the CEO cares about. I’m also willing (even happy) to be down “in the weeds” — especially when it’s in service to a C-suite type of problem. 

I really care about my work feeling like it matters. I have a hard time “faking it” and tend to phone it in when a work project feels “pretend.”

I like to be in the room where it happens (cue Leslie Odom Jr.), in part because that’s where the hardest problems are tackled and another part because I want a comprehensive view of the problem. 

I like to see things through to completion. I find it frustrating when there’s a long trail of half-finished decks or documents, initiatives that kicked off but didn’t wrap up, or slack channels full of crickets. I can manage a lot of different projects at once, but sometimes that leads to not seeing things through as much as I would like.  

**What I’m good at**.

I am a generalist — maybe in the best and worst sense. Best in that I am happy to learn something new, confident that I can figure it out, and capable in ambiguity. Worst in that I don’t necessarily fit a clear job description, sometimes I’m overconfident in a new area, and I don’t always stay “in my lane”.

I am really comfortable with numbers (sometimes too comfortable, see bellow). Spreadsheets, charts, analysis, Python and linear regressions. I used to be able to do a lot more heavy math and I definitely miss that. 

I can structure a problem or a document quickly (thanks, consulting). I can write a good memo in a matter of days (sometimes hours with enough context pre-loaded). 

I can move quickly — the hardest part is often just getting started. 

**When I’m at my best**.

When I’m at my best, multiple people have said I have a calming presence, that I bring a sense of comfort, ease, wisdom, thoughtfulness, and care to work, and that I know when to jump in to steer/guide/correct a conversation. 

People experience me as a good listener, someone who is easy to work with and who they can hold confidence in. 

“Expansive curiosity.” I am interested in lots of different topics and I like to share articles, books, tweets with people. Someone once said that made me “like an onion” which might be a compliment. 

High standards. I want to see excellence and be proud of the work that I do — I’m not usually comfortable with “good enough”. I set a high bar for myself, and at my best I help other people see and reach a high bar too, and to celebrate what we accomplish. 

**When I’m not at my best**. 

When I’m not at my best I can be really critical, and sometimes in a way that feels more at a person than at the work. 

Not at my best I am not good at receiving feedback, and can take constructive criticism personally instead of as helpful to solve a problem. 

Not at my best I tend to go into “do it myself mode” and be unwilling to delegate or share work. I can fall into assumptions that “this can’t be done by so and so.”

My wife could probably say a lot more here!

**What I’m working on**.

I am trying to identify an authentic communication style that works for me. Specifically I am generally quiet, and my default mode is generally to not speak up or to speak up less — much less than I should or is helpful to my team. People have told me that when I speak up they expect it to be impactful. I don’t want to lose that candor or “oomph” — keeping it authentic — while also communicating a bit more often, authoritatively, and directly. I think this is something necessary if I’m to manage people successfully. 

I am also trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up. I have really bopped around from maybe wanting to be an economics professor, to working as a management consultant, to working in a think tank, to working in Operations at a nonprofit. I’m sort of learning to code on the side. Sometimes I think I’d like to just work on a farm. Over time some focus will probably be beneficial. 

**How I like to communicate / work**.

A bit more tactical. 

I prefer to meet with my manager 1:1 at least weekly if not more often. I like having standing team sessions where everyone can contribute to the agenda or bring a problem to solve. 

Feedback. I like it, I want more of it, I want to give feedback to my manager and to my team.

I like having longer blocks of time for focused work, but I can handle getting things done in 15 minutes at a time. 

I try to keep my calendar up to date so that it’s easy to find time to meet or to focus on a piece of work. 

I prefer Slack or text to email (Gen Z here). Email just takes so much longer. I will Slack or text you back after regular working hours but leave an email til the morning. 

We have a dog and I often like to wrap up work as I walk the dog in the evening. I might send a voice message or some extra thoughts around then. I don’t expect responses and mostly I’m trying to clear my head and think ahead.
