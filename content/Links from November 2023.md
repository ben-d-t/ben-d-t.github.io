1: [A very good 1hr introduction to LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g&t=1s) , a talk by Andrej Karpathy. It helps to know a little bit before jumping in, but this is a clear and information dense explainer that gets you pretty much caught up to what's public knowledge. 

2: [Podcast with Claire Hughes Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhwM-ovrNo0) , a 2hr interview with one of the top operators in Silicon Valley on The Logan Bartlett Show. I highly recommend her book [Scaling People](https://press.stripe.com/scaling-people) 

3: [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) - an incredibly easy wrapper to find, download, and run local LLMs. Probably not immediately *useful* without a powerful machine (>16GB RAM) but great for *learning*. And some notes from what I learned [[Tinkering with local LLMs]]. 

4: [4.5 Billion Years in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7TUe5w6RHo) a fun "to-scale" background video from Kurzgesagt.

5: Fun fact from [The History of the Electric Car ](https://www.energy.gov/articles/history-electric-car): In 1910 30% of vehicles in the US had electric engines. I heard this listening to Cobalt Red by Siddharth Kara, which I do recommend. 

6: [The Collapse of Rational Certainty](https://meaningness.com/collapse-of-rational-certainty) - an essay arguing that some tension of contemporary culture are downstream from the end of rationalist certainty, which collapsed due to a series of surprise discoveries in the twentieth century (e.g., non-Euclidean geometry, Einstein's general relativity, quantum theory, and crises in mathematics illustrated by [Goedel's Incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel%27s_incompleteness_theorems)) (nb unfortunately the site appears down as of 2023-12-02)

7: [Kelvin Kiptum to run 2024 Rotterdam Marathon](https://worldathletics.org/competitions/world-athletics-label-road-races/news/kelvin-kiptum-target-marathon-record-rotterdam-2024), and fast: "I’ll try at least to beat my world record here. I know I’m capable of doing that, if my preparation works out well and the conditions are OK. And in that case, I will get close to the two-hour barrier, so why not aim to break it? That might look ambitious, but I’m not afraid of setting this kind of goals. There’s no limit to human energy."

8: [About the Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info/About.html). A couple times a year I find myself back in the Library of Babel, which contains every piece of text that could ever be written (in English). 

9: [Startup advice from levels.io](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1724046613482549706). I've been trying to avoid it, but TikTok does seem to be the first platform that will distribute your content to at least a handful of people *and* show it to a ton of people if it performs well. Other platforms seem to rely much more on a creator's past performance.

10: [Perhaps intergenerational mobility has not declined in the United States after all](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/11/perhaps-intergenerational-mobility-has-not-declined-in-the-united-states-after-all.html). A new paper finding a different trend than [Chetty et al 2016](https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-fading-american-dream/). I've read the latter but would like to read this new one and write up some thoughts on the difference. 

11: [The Purple Leash Project](https://www.purina.com/purple-leash-project) - 17% of domestic violence shelters accept pets; 48% of domestic abuse survivors report delaying leaving because they can't bring their pets. This feels like a no brainer to fix? Is there more to it? Perhaps the first Spotify ad I've actually clicked on. The women's shelter near us is not able to accommodate pets.  

12: [Stratechery on OpenAI chaos](https://stratechery.com/2023/openais-misalignment-and-microsofts-gain/), which is sense... resolved? 

13: [xkcd: Tasks](https://xkcd.com/1425/) - how times have changed. 

14: [Text is the universal interface](https://scale.com/blog/text-universal-interface), another essay I find myself sharing more than once. What problems do I deal with that are only or mostly about text? 

15: [Paul Graham on nonprofits](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1124254508232663040), and the intrinsic accountability and constraints of profit motivation.

16: [The Maintenance Race - Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-maintenance-race/) by Stewart Brand on the around-the-world solo sailboat race of 1968. "Its drama continues to echo half a century later because three of the nine competitors became legendary – the one who won, the one who didn’t bother to win, and the one who cheated."

17: [Opinion | This Is Not the Way to Help Depressed Teenagers](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/opinion/teenagers-mental-health-treatment.html) - Multiple papers showing large-scale, "light touch" mental health interventions have backfired. 

18: [The state of next-generation geothermal energy](https://elidourado.com/blog/geothermal/) and [Is Geothermal Really Going to be a Thing?](https://austinvernon.site/blog/geothermal.html) -- two contrasting views on the future of geothermal energy. 

19: [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) - a talk from 2015 in which the speaker argues that the predominant form of the social web -- the Stream -- is an impoverished model for learning and research. Instead, the integrative and iterative approach of the Garden is more suited for building a deep pool of knowledge.

20: Yes, [The world has enough minerals for low-carbon electricity](https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/minerals-for-electricity). I intend to read [Hannah Ritchie's upcoming book](https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/294343/hannah-ritchie)
