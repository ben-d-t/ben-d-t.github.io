> Results and reflections from training to qualify for the Boston Marathon (sub 3-hr time). It took me five tries to reach that goal. My general takeaway after running a bunch of marathons pretty close together is that the race result hinges on three factors: training, conditions, and execution. In part those are obvious. But what's helpful in this framework is realizing that you can't have more than one of these go wrong, especially because the marathon is so long.

- [[pc-bookshelf|Categorizing Patrick Collison's Bookshelf]] - Patrick Collison has a list of almost 800 books on his blog representing most of the books he owns. I used a simple python script and the OpenAI API to have GPT-4 sort and categorize the almost 800 books that Collison has. I was surprised at how many Biography & Memoir books Collison has and recommends. And a healthy dose of Literature & Fiction too. This project was also decent practice on what prompts work with this generation of LLMs for a sort of data processing task.
