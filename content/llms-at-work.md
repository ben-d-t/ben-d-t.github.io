> Compiled in 2023. A rough list of tips for using "AI" in a desk job that I've shared more than once.

Here’s roughly what I’ve been doing: 

1. Start paying for one of the best models (as of March 2024 that's probably still ChatGPT Plus for GPT-4 -- because that's the easiest very good model to access). For a while I paid out of pocket for work use
   
2. Have the chat open in a separate browser window all day. More likely you’ll use it. 

3. Try lots of different tasks -- especially every time that you "feel stuck"

4. If you feel like "well that didn't work" -- assume it was *your prompt* that was the most of the problem, not model -- try a better prompt at least x3 before you give up. Also save & reuse prompts. Just put these in text files or something like that. 

5. There is value even if you don't directly use what a LLM puts out -- Brainstorming, getting unstuck, increasing confidence in your answer, "how do I" etc. 

6. The latest models are not great UI great UI for writing/editing but it's still good for "draft a memo about xyz" as a starting poitn

7. Steer prompts towards the right answer space -> e.g., "write a memo LIKE STRIPE does"
