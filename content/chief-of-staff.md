### 0. Why I’m interested
Executives at businesses of all kinds are hiring for a “chief of staff” (CoS) type role. I think that type of job seems interesting. It’s also similar to what I’ve done in a couple contexts. So, I am writing about what I learn and think about this job category. I want to be intentional about the types of roles I take on. 

I'm using "chief of staff" here as shorthand for a bunch of different roles that may or may not actually have that title. The main difference between a general "Strategy & Operations" role versus "CoS" is how much you work with the CEO or executive leadership team. 

### 1. What is a “chief of staff”?
Originally a role mostly in [government and military institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff), executives at a wide variety of organizations now hire roles under a title of CoS or other similarly vague titles like “Special Projects” or “Strategy & Operations" or "Exec Ops".

I think of a “chief of staff” as a good descriptor for someone who:
- (A) Has no (or few) direct reports
- (B) Reports direct to an executive 
- (C) Works as a highly capacity generalist

Some job descriptions from Q4 2023:
- [Chief of Staff, Product at Patreon](https://wellfound.com/jobs/2806612-chief-of-staff-product) [(a)](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007150208/https://wellfound.com/jobs/2806612-chief-of-staff-product)
- [Chief of Staff, National Institute of Science and Technology (due to CHIPS Act)](https://www.usajobs.gov/job/752218200) [(a)](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007150643/https://www.usajobs.gov/job/752218200)
- [Chief of Staff & Culture, The Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.on-ramps.com/jobs/2985) [(a)](https://web.archive.org/web/20231007151507/https://www.on-ramps.com/jobs/2985)

There's quite a range of industries and scopes of responsibility for the same job title. I think that shows lots of organizations feel a need for someone who can handle variety and ambiguity. Does that "felt need" actually mean they should hire a CoS? Maybe, maybe not. 

### 2. Why would you hire one?
A CoS augments leadership’s capacity. Leaders are increasingly busy and stretched thin as the world moves faster, work becomes more complex, and society expects more of businesses (see [CEO Excellence by Carolyn Dewar](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58438620), [Deep Work by Cal Newport](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25744928)). Couldn't it be nice to have a right-hand who could problem-solve with you, run meetings in your stead, and lead projects? Another way to put it is that [creating leverage is the meta-responsibility of the role](https://medium.com/chiefofstaffnetwork/state-of-chief-of-staff-in-tech-2021-3b188c7eb4a) 

[Matt Mochary recommends](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-tcubUwvktoV-Ou3bB6ynk2LLwNzdT3D_p_ILreyR_A/edit) an Exec Ops role (formerly CoS) as the first hire a startup should make. 

Another type of leverage would be someone who can kickstart research ideas from leadership without distracting another team. Call it a [technical chief of staff](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1480642842296938496). That would be more of a hybrid of a Special Projects and CoS role. 

Also, a CoS (or COO for that matter) helps round out a leadership team. No one is perfect — instead of a founder or CEO trying to be perfect, they can look for someone with complementary strengths (see [The Dynamics of a Founder and COO with Chris Monk and David Perell - Secret Ops | Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0D063ZgE4znworkattobBf?si=B1ZOihyQTHqT6_Vr55bwqQ)). Not as an excuse to be bad at certain parts of the job, but as a way to run a better company without trying for individual perfection. 

### 3. Is it for me?
Over time I’m learning more about my strengths and interests:

**I seem to be a generalist.** 
- I enjoy being a generalist in life and work. I write about a variety of interests (see [[index|Home]]). In management consulting I liked working in a variety of industries. 
- I’m pretty good as a generalist already. I did well in management consulting as a generalist, and my next role after that was also quite generalist (see [[about|About]])
- I seem to be better at this type of role than others. I don’t seem to like doing the same work over and over again. I like to change up projects pretty often. I also don’t think I’m that good at managing people — yet; I’m getting better. 
- I’m working on my toolkit. I’m learning to code more, tinkering with AI projects, [[writing|writing more]], and testing/proving my assumptions about what I like and don’t in my current role 

**I like working with exec leadership.**
- I want to have the C-Suite perspective on a business. I want to work where on the problems with the most impact. I don’t mind getting into the weeds but it takes more energy for me to focus on problems that ”feel small”
- I like to be in [the room where it happens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMD14n4UOVQ). 
- You can “punch above your weight” in impact, because you can often work in these roles at a much younger age / with less experience than the executive role. 

**I want to learn a lot quickly.**
- You can learn from the decision maker instead of actually being in the hot seat for big decisions. 
- You (hopefully) receive high quality mentoring/coaching and access to soft networks that wouldn’t otherwise be available. 

### 4. What are the challenges?
Much of these notes are drawn from [10,000 Hours with Reid Hoffman](https://casnocha.com/reid-hoffman-lessons) which is a great read. 
- You’ll usually work the executive’s hours. I can grind. But be clear eyed that these roles are not a clear nine to five. 
- Job description will be unclear and scope will be unclear. Even with a well written RD — which I’ve had in a generalist role — usually that is still just clearly writing down vague responsibilities. Be ready to deal with ambiguity. 
- High risk / high reward type of role. One person in particular — your boss — shapes almost all of the experience. That’s more true than a typical manager because you might not have a larger team or a skip-level manager or other teams where the role could fit at all. Be discerning and ready to move on at the right time. 

Beware the status cycle. There's often a title getting attention every few years as the "generalist role for the hotshot ex-consultants." Karl Yang calls this [The Status Cycle](https://chiefofstuff.substack.com/p/the-job-status-cycle) and suggested a couple years ago that "CoS" was on the decline phase. Two notes: Don't pick a role because it feels "high status." And be discerning about roles when the job title has become overrated. 

Yes "generalist role for the hotshot ex-consultants" hits a bit close to home -- that's why I want to be thoughtful about what specifically I'm good at and what I'm looking for.
