I currently live in the Washington, DC area and work at [BibleProject](https://www.bibleproject.com). I grew up in many places and studied economics and math at UVA (go hoos). I started this portfolio because I want to get better at writing and programming. It's supposed to be a collection of topics and projects that I'm interested in. We'll see how it grows.
