title: Compressing the best ideas is hard

The best ideas are information dense. Not complicated, but filled with meaning. 

One of my favorite essays is [by Max Roser](https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better) with this tagline:
> The world is awful. The world is much better. The world can be much better.

It's amazing! This might be Roser's [core idea](https://youtu.be/FPFqB1P9BIo?si=sSfTSMMIXNTwLG_F&t=3000). But it still took *years* to distill this idea into such a crisp, clear tagline. Roser founded Our World in Data (OWID) in 2011. The essay was [originally published in 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181107145209/https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better) but with a different tagline and a narrower focus.

So, if it took *so long* for Roser to clearly communicate this core idea, what does this mean?
- Getting to information density is difficult. So distilling *and* communicating the best ideas is hard too.
- There is lots of room for better ideas. Even when you've been working on a topic for a decade+, there is still room to compress a good idea to a better idea.
