1: [Jesse Lastunen - AI for Economists](https://sites.google.com/view/lastunen/ai-for-economists). Example prompts showing how LLMs can benefit economists. Reminds me of this practical [talk from Kevin Bryan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJGQjozWr0E) which at a ripe 8 months old is now relevant in principles but perhaps irrelevant in the details. Economics seems to be adopting faster than other fields; I wonder why? 

2: [How to Discover Your Own Taste - Ezra Klein Podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-kyle-chayka.html). I’m working towards developing taste this year. Appreciated the re-frame in this podcast that taste is personal, not fixed. Related: [Dan Shipper](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-knowledge-economy-is-over-welcome-to-the-allocation-economy), [Henry Oliver](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/how-to-have-good-taste), and [David Perell](https://perell.com/essay/annual-review-2022/) on taste. 

3: [Why Is There So Much Fraud in Academia? - Freakonomics](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/why-is-there-so-much-fraud-in-academia/). On the social science replication crisis, in part. Stephen says there’s “much less shady research in economics” compared to other fields. But I’m not sure: landmark papers recently under substantial critique Or debate include  [inequality](https://www.city-journal.org/article/thomas-pikettys-motte-and-bailey/), [intergenerational mobility](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/11/perhaps-intergenerational-mobility-has-not-declined-in-the-united-states-after-all.html), and [housing](https://marketurbanism.com/2023/11/13/an-autopsy-of-hsieh-moretti-2019/). (I’m extra bummed about the alleged coding errors in Hsieh & Moretti because of [[housing|my interest in housing]])

4: [Tax Burden by State: 2022 State and Local Taxes | Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/state/tax-burden-by-state-2022/). I think the takeaway is you can live where you want, on average; income tax or property tax, pick your poison. Unless you want to live in New York State.

5: [Joschua’s Notes](https://notes.joschua.io) and especially [Bible Study Kit for Obsidian](https://notes.joschua.io/eRfus12eKKP8TRELSeFaD2). Related, are you working on [The Garden or the Stream](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/? )

6: [Easy Org Chart](https://www.easyorgchart.xyz). Spreadsheet data to editable Google Slides in one click! I built and published this Google Workspace add-on. Coding was the easy part compared to navigating details of OAuth and App review? See [[content/projects|projects]].

7: [Skiff](https://skiff.com). Private, mostly open-source mail, calendar, drive, and docs. Also [Sovereign Computing | Start9](https://start9.com). 

8: [Bring Back the Sabbath](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/bring-back-the-sabbath/). Another focus for me this year. 

9: [On the Marble Cliffs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61149811). 5 stars, recommending, but I’m not smart enough to explain why so also [this review](https://regressstudies.substack.com/p/young-lords-and-their-traces). 

10: [Impact of Mobile Phone Screen Exposure on Adolescents’ Cognitive Health - PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9566493/). “It is estimated that adolescents spend approximately 4hr per day engaged in leisure-time sedentary screen-based behavior (SSBB). 

11: [$190K per month from bootstrapped AI dating assistant](https://x.com/debarghya_das/status/1748014098967912456). Build something people want!

12: [Tim Ferriss: How I Write Podcast ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0rSsKBHt1g9z1ajkCgM5A1?si=bJj5bR9ORjWh8k-zuNyybA). To build a habit, do less than you think you can. There’s a glut of mediocrity; don’t contribute to that. 

13: [[Working with me]]

14: [OpenAI new embedding models and API updates](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) Costs going down yet again. [[Tinkering with local LLMs|When local LLMs will be useful]]? Free isn’t really cheaper than ~$0 — I don’t stop to pick up pennies on the sidewalk... 

15: [How To Legally Own Another Person | by Nassim Nicholas Taleb | INCERTO](https://medium.com/incerto/how-to-legally-own-another-person-4145a1802bf6). Linked without much background. I wonder how reception of ideas like this will change as work shifts over the next couple decades. 

16: [Poem/1: AI rhyming clock by Matt Webb — Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/genmon/poem-1-the-ai-poetry-clock). LLMs unlock simple ideas that used to be impractical.
