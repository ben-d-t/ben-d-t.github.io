   <h2>More</h2>
   <p>A bit of a grab bag of writing or notes that don't yet fit elsewhere.</p>
   <h3>1. Are we getting more selfish over time?</h3>
   <p>A brief look at Google Ngram data. The use of the word "I" as a share of all words has increased 3X since 1980.</p>
   <h3>2. <a href="/collison-bookshelf">Categorizing Patrick Collison's Bookshelf</a></h3>
   <p>Patrick Collison has a list of almost 800 books on his blog representing most of the books he owns. 
    I used a simple python script and the OpenAI API to have GPT-4 sort and categorize the almost 800 books that Collison has.
    I was surprised at how many Biography & Memoir books Collison has and recommends. And a healthy dose of Literature & Fiction too.  
    This project was also decent practice on what prompts work with this generation of LLMs for a sort of data processing task.

   <h3>3. <a href="/marathons">Thoughts on marathon training</a></h3>
   <p>Results and reflections from training to qualify for the Boston Marathon (sub 3-hr time). It took me five tries to reach that goal.
    My general takeaway after running a bunch of marathons pretty close together is that the race result hinges on three factors:
    training, conditions, and execution. In part those are obvious. But what's helpful in this frameowrk is realizing that you can't have more
    than one of these go wrong, especially becuase the marathon is so long.
