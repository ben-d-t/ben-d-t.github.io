   <h2>Patrick Collison's Bookshelf</h2>
   <h3 id="0-the-bookshelf">0. The bookshelf</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Collison">Patrick Collison</a> (co-founder, CEO of Stripe) has a bookshelf page with a long list of books and a few recommendations: <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf">Bookshelf · Patrick Collison</a>. And it’s not just a wishful to-read list. <a href="https://www.justgogrind.com/p/patrick-collison">He reads a lot</a>. The bookshelf lists most of the physical books Patrick owns, of which he’s read about half. </p>
<p>The bookshelf’s in no particular order. Not even alphabetical. Patrick writes “Since the stacks and shelves lack any particular order, so does this list.” There’s something fun about and whimsical about that and I like it. But it makes it hard to use the list for anything other than just browsing or a quick “ctrl+f” to see if he has or likes a particular book. </p>
<p>So I had GPT-4 help me compile and then categorize the list.</p>
<h3 id="1-the-results">1. The results</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s a Google Sheet of the bookshelf: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1olzx87nTVH3qmy_QL2zwuwDi_gTPklhjqgwzc9_AkTU/edit?usp=sharing">CollisonBookshelf - Google Sheets</a></p>

<p>Some summary stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are close to 800 books (778 with a few duplicates)</li>
<li>The titles plus subtitles make up more than 6,000 words (titles only are less than 3,000)</li>
<li>That&#39;s almost 40,000 characters -- meaning gpt-4-32k could take a shot at the whole list at once, if only I had access</li>
<li>17 books are on the shelf more than once; just one book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61552">Popper Selections</a> is on there x3, leaving 760 unique books</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-some-observations-about-the-categories">2. Some observations about the categories</h3>
<p><strong>Clusters with many books:</strong>
There are, not surprisingly, a lot of books that broadly fall under “Science &amp; Technology.” I’m also surprised at how many books there are about Aviation! But it turns out <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickc/status/711226514960945153">both</a> <a href="https://www.altfi.com/article/8178_private-jets-are-so-last-year-fintech-entrepreneur-john-collison-is-buying-an-airport">Collison brothers</a> are pilots. There’s also an interesting cluster around Design, including books about Urban Planning, Typography, Visual Arts, and Creativity. </p>
<p>After “Science &amp; Technology” two of the next biggest mega-categories are “Literature &amp; Fiction” and “Biography &amp; Memoir.” That might be what stands out the most — it’s not like Collison’s bookshelf is mostly Science, Business, Economics, and Politics with not much else in between. </p>
<p>”Biography &amp; Memoir” also makes up a disproportionate 30% (6 of 20) share of the green books — which Collison says are “particularly great.”</p>
<p><strong>Clusters with only a few books:</strong> 
There are only a handful of “self-help” or “pop business” books (GPT-4 categorized twice as many books as “Business &amp; Economics” as opposed to “Business &amp; Management”). </p>
<p>It didn’t make the final cut but in all the testing I saw just one book specific enough to Stripe’s business model to get tagged as “Payment Systems.”</p>
<p>Yes, some of the categories overlap (are “Science and Technology” vs ”Technology and Science” really that different?) </p>
<h3 id="3-some-learnings-for-programming-with-gpt">3. Some learnings for programming with GPT</h3>
<p>I started out with a prompt something like “Please sort, order, and categorize the following list of books. Each book should be in only one category. Please return the list in this format: <strong>Category</strong>: book1, book2, book3, etc…” and the final prompt wasn’t that different. </p>
<p>Using the chat.OpenAI.com interface was going to take way too long so I ended up building a script that looped through the .CSV file of books and sent a chunk at a time through the API. </p>
<p>The downside here is the request token limit — you can only do so many books at once. The current token limit for gpt-3.5-turbo is circa 4,000 tokens. For gpt-4 it’s just over 8,000 tokens. </p>
<p>But in practice I had to keep these prompts well under the token limit. The more books at once, the more that would be “missed” and not returned in the output. gpt-3.5-turbo seemed to drop more books than gpt-4. In the end even with gpt-4 I changed the script to go back through a second time and re-do any uncategorized books. </p>
<p>gpt-3.5-turbo also seemed to create <em>more</em> categories, and would more often have a single book in a really niche category. That sort of ”creativity” might have been fun except that it was leading to something like 150 categories off 600 books. And it was less “creative connections between books” and more “made-up specificity.” </p>
<p>I also tried Claude with the 100k context window but it didn’t perform nearly as well at this task with the same prompt. Maybe a different task or a smaller set at a time would have been better. </p>
<p>I think with practice a more complex prompt to gpt-4 would’ve also been more reliable. </p>
<p>Lastly I only did a bit of spot-checking around what books ended up in what categories. I’m sure there are some that are way off. </p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming w/ gpt-4’s help is so great</li>
<li>Simple prompts get 80% of the way there but not 100%</li>
<li>Cleaning and checking output is hard but necessary if you need reliability</li>
</ol>
