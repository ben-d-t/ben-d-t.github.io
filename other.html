   <h3>2. Categorizing Patrick Collison's Bookshelf</h3>
   <p>Patrick Collison has a list of almost 800 books on his blog representing most of the books he owns. 
    I used a simple python script and the OpenAI API to have GPT-4 sort and categorize the almost 800 books that Collison has.
    I was surprised at how many Biography & Memoir books Collison has and recommends. And a healthy dose of Literature & Fiction too.  
    This project was also decent practice on what prompts work with this generation of LLMs for a sort of data processing task.
